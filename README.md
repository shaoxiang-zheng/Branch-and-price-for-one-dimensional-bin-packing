# Branch-and-price-for-one-dimensional-bin-packing
It's the implementation for "A New Branch-and-Price-and-Cut Algorithm for OneDimensional Bin-Packing Problems"

Environment: python 3.8 and Gurobi 900

To run the code, just open the main.py and run it.

To invoke the algorithm for another instance, just create a .txt file with the same format with data.txt

Thanks for reporting me the bugs and the potential improvemtns in effiencicy.
